> __Note:__ This is the CanJS [can-route](https://github.com/canjs/can-route) module. The old `can-route` has been renamed to [did-route](https://www.npmjs.com/package/did-route). Many thanks to [@michaelrhodes](https://github.com/michaelrhodes) for letting us use the `can-route` module name.

Create a route matching rule. Optionally provide defaults that will be applied to the [can-map] when the route matches.
